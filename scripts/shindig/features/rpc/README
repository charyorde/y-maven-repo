Override the default Shindig rpc feature to fix the flash transport for IE7 support.

With the current Shindig version, the flash transport only register the child frame to the flash component once after the 
ready callback from the flash component.
The only modified file is the flash.transport.js to call flushHandshakes() function once the 
JAF container setup app for rpc transport.

Filed SHINDIG-1678 Jira case to track this issue.
