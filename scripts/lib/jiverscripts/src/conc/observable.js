/**
 * This is a mix in that can add methods to any object for emitting events and
 * for registering event listeners.  This can be useful, for example, to create
 * view classes that emit events that a controller class can listen to and
 * handle.  That way view classes can push information to the controller
 * without having to know about the implementation of the controller.
 *
 * jive.conc.observable is a function.  Call it with some object as an argument
 * and it will add methods to that object.  For example:
 *
 *     var MyClass = function(...) { ... };
 *     jive.conc.observable(MyClass.prototype);
 *
 *     var myObj = new MyClass();
 *     myObj.addListener('someChange', function(changedValue) {
 *         alert(changedValue + ' just changed!');
 *     });
 *     myObj.listeners('someChange');  //=> [function(changedValue) { ... }]
 *
 * The events that jive.conc.observable makes possible are completely distinct
 * from DOM events.  These events are triggered on JavaScript objects, not DOM
 * elements.  However as with DOM events, listeners registered via
 * jive.conc.observable will be called asynchronously.  That means that
 * whatever bit of code emits an event will have to return control to the event
 * loop before any event listeners are called.
 *
 * Events may include any number of event parameters, which will be passed as
 * arguments to event listeners.
 *
 * Event listeners will be invoked in the context of the observable object.  So
 * in the body of an event listener `this` will refer to the object that
 * emitted the event.
 *
 * @class
 * @param   {Object}    klass   object to mix observable methods into
